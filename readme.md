Open a text editor (like Notepad, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
Copy all the code from the platform shooter game
Save the file with a .html extension, such as platform-shooter.html


Open the file in a browser:

Locate the saved HTML file on your computer
Double-click the file, or right-click and select "Open with" and choose a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
The game should open and run in your browser window


For the best experience:

Use a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

If the game feels laggy, close other resource-intensive applications

Space: Jump
W/S: Climb ladders when touching them

The game is a standalone HTML file, so you don't need to install any special software or run a server to play it. It uses standard HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript which are supported by all modern browsers.
